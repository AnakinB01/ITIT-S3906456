                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>The project idea I have formulated and will discuss is a web-based aeronautical emergency tool. The application will source telemetry data from the user’s device, extrapolate it and then display it back to the user in the form of navigational and instrumentational graphs/diagrams etc. </p>
                <p>The use of this web-based application is targeted but not limited to pilots in emergency situations where loss of electrical power/vacuum suction within the aircraft’s cockpit causes the instruments built in to fail. In this event, users can open the application, allow it to run and gain access to backup instrument aids at their fingertips.</p>
                <p>The intended users of this application are pilots all around the world regardless of the aircraft type they fly and how much experience they have.</p>

            <div class="motivation">
                <h1>Motivation:</h1>
                <p>Learning to fly myself, I have been presented with the dangers of stepping foot in the cockpit of an aircraft every time I go up into the sky. We are constantly assessing our surrounding while flying to locate safe landing areas in case of an emergency engine failure but yet we never assess what would happen if our instruments suddenly failed.</p>
                <p>A lot of us pilots who are not flying multi-million-dollar aircraft do not have access to backup instrumentation and thus this is one of the leading factors into the 220 aircraft accidents that occurred in 2019 within Australia. This alarming statistic provided me with sufficient motivation to take action and plan and application that solves this issue.</p>
                <p>Also, according to Statista.com, there was 666,565 active pilots in the United States in 2019. This shown me that there definitely is a market out there for this application and since there are no competitors, if people wanted a solution to instrumentation failure, my application would suffice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <h1>Description:</h1>
                <p>The web-based application I have designed to formulate will present users with an array of navigational and instrumentational aids to assist in flight if they require. The user will simply access the web, key in the address for the application and allow it to record live telemetry data from their device such as a phone.</p>
                <p>The features the application will possess are as follows. First, users will be able to navigate a map which will provide their exact location, and this is achieved through a GPS link established by the user’s device. The navigation of this map can be done by hand or query where users can search by aircraft-related fields such as nearest airport, nearest fuel station and so on.</p>
                <P>This will assist the user in performing navigational changes and implementations midflight in case of an emergency. The software built into the web application should select optimum glide angles in case of engine failure and direct routes to the users desired destination based on preselect information or custom aircraft data.</P>
                <p>The second feature users can access is the aircraft-data section. This area on the web application will provide users with live-time airspeed, elevation above mean sea level (MSL) and vertical speed indications in feet per minute (how fast the plane is climbing/descending).  Users can also expand and customize their default layout of this section to display instrument relevant to them in case of an emergency.</p>
                <p>The user will finally have access to a customized section where they can create notes, store reminders and also perform fuel calculations in an instant with preset aircraft data available. There will also be an optional section which can be toggled which will enable the web-based application to automatically dial emergency services if no user input is detected within a defined time period which the user sets.</p>
                <p>In terms of the design of the web application, it will take a very minimalistic approach since the user will not want cluttered information thrown at them in an emergency situation. The color scheme chosen with take a very prominent and vibrant feel with key indications and data highlighted for ease of access and readability by the users. </p>
                <p>For accessibility, users can customize the color scheme and invert colors if required, also magnification and text size can be altered to accommodate the customers needs. The feature of text-to-speech can be implemented possibly in the scenario in which the user cannot spend time looking at their phone but wants to receive custom callouts of aircraft data they need.</p>
                <p>The application will also be responsive to all common device types so if the user is using a tablet or a phone, the application should self-scale and not prevent information from being displayed in an effective manner.</p>
                <p>The combination of all these features should be able to achieve the single goal set out in the formulation of this web-based app, which is to maximize safety and efficiency in the air if an emergency ever did come about, and utilizing live telemetry data from the user’s device, we can provide them with their entire key instrumentational aids on the one screen.</p>

                <h1>Tools and Technologies:</h1>
                <p>To be able to develop and run this web-based application, it will require a few tools. Firstly, to develop and upkeep the backend of the app, JavaScript will be used as the programming language due to its extensive abilities and fast compute speed where it is sometimes more than 10x faster than Ruby and Python. For the front-end development of this web app, HTML and CSS will be used and due to the app starting off basic and not having added features, a framework is not required to assist in the development of the app. </p>
                <p>Later down the track a possible framework could be Ulkit since it is known for its minimalist approach. Finally, the host the web application, a hosting provider such as A2 Hosting will be used as they have some of the fastest loading speeds which is required for our application. For the deployment of our web application to the host we can use the DevOps lifecycle tool GitLab.</p>
                <p>To be able to also run this web-based application, the user must have a device with built in sensors and a stable connection to achieve live data and access the web app.</p>

          <div class="skillsreq">
              <h1>Skills Required:</h1>
              <p>The skills required for this project will be at an advanced level. The developer will first have to have experience in back-end and front-end web development through the use of JavaScript and CSS/HTML. The development of code that extracts live data from a user’s device must be developed and then translated into info graphs on the screen to the user will also be required and will need someone who is proficient at coding to develop. The structure of the web app will require knowledge of CSS Grid and Flexbox as well as API integration for maps (Google Maps API). </p>
              <p>The knowledge of contrasting color schemes and font-size for all people must also be contained within the developer’s skillset. Another skill is the deployment and upkeep of the app and the developer must be proficient with tools such as GitLab and analytical website management.</p>
              <p>No special devices will be required to develop this project other than a computer to construct the application via a text editor such as VSCode and also a device for testing such a smart phone.</p>
              <p>In terms of feasibility to find the skills and software required, it should be fairly basic and straight forward. All programming languages and software can be found online and are accessible to everyone, and the hardware will not be a problem as most people can gain access to a smart device.</p>
              <p>Finding a developer or gaining knowledge of CSS/HTML and JavaScript should be straight forward as well since these are some of the most popular front and back-end languages around the world, so there is lots of instruction online about them and a lot of people proficient in their ways.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="outcome">
              <h1>Outcome:</h1>
              <p>On completion of the project and if it is successful, it should result in a pathway for pilots to safely navigate out of an emergency situation revolving around instrumentation failure. The problem of not knowing what to do and having no live data to accurately fly the aircraft in these situations will disappear as everyone has access to live data feeds on their smart devices in such case. </p>
              <p>Hopefully the development of this project shows a reduction in aircraft emergencies and fatalities globally and we can create a more safe and secure environment in the cockpit not only for the pilots but for everyone in the aviation industry as a whole.</p>
