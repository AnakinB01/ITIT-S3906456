                <p>In terms of my qualifications and experience, I have been able to develop quite a few through High school and my part time job.

For skills, qualifications and experience in the I.T field, working at the Good Guys in the Tech area has provided me with a strong foundation for the further development of my I.T knowledge.</p>
                <p>I understand and compute well with the components and parts to a computer, <strong>basic operations</strong> and debugging as well as <strong>system diagnosis</strong>. High school also provided me with knowledge of database systems like <strong>MySQL</strong>, a strong understanding of algorithms and coding through <strong>Visual Basic</strong> as well as simple but effective front end web development and design.

                <h1>A structred plan on how i will achieve the required skills and qualifications for this position</h1>
                <p>Referencing the previous paragraph, I do require a lot of experience to participate and apply for the job I am looking at and the way I will be able to achieve this is as follows. One of the first requirements the job states is a minimum of 5 years' experience in the industry. To achieve this, after university, on completion of my master's degree, I will try and get selected to work as a <strong>first-year junior cyber analyst</strong> through an agency such as <strong>Halycyon Knights</strong>.</p>
                <p>To be competitive in job selection and assist me with the requirements of the <strong>Cyber Security Analyst position</strong>, I will have to further my own development and knowledge of threat mitigation, penetration testing and my knowledge of several I.T applications such as <strong>SIEM</strong>. Completing my masters of Cyber Security will lead me on the right pathway to understanding these skills and developing them. Alongside study, I will also platform a lot of self-learning through interacting with these applications, using and developing my knowledge of MySQL and database software and general coding which is at the basis of most I.T professions and also possibly take and online course in <strong>threat auditing and management</strong>.</p>
                <p>I can also use a lot on penetration tools included in the <strong>Kali Linux</strong> software to penetration test and then further perform threat analysis and detection on generated attacks within Kali. In summary, the completion of my masters in cyber security, self-study at home by delving into more in <strong>depth database management, coding and threat analysis and mitigation</strong> and possibly the chance to work as a junior Cyber Analyst will allow me to be seated in the right position for the job with Global Payments.</p>
