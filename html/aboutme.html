                <h1>Background Information:</h1>
            <p>I was born in the regional town of Ballarat in November 2002. Within my family I have a younger sister and brother who were also both born here. 
                    I attended primary and middle school at <strong>Ballarat and Clarendon College</strong> and then transitioned to <strong>St. Patrick's College</strong> in Ballarat for  high school.</p>
            <p>I completed Year 12 last year in 2020 during a global pandemic and am now currently studying a <strong>Bachelor of Information Technology</strong> at RMIT in the city of Melbourne. 
                    English has been my lingua franca at home between my family and myself and I have never ventured out to speak another language. An interesting fact about myself is that I'm currently learning to fly. </p>
            <p>Dad has been a pilot in his spare time since I was born, and I was introduced to the world of aviation at a very young age and hence the passion has been adopted overtime. We currently own a light plane that we fly around Victoria and Australia and is well known for its striking color scheme. 
                    Other past times of mine include gaming, Iâ€™m an avid player in games such as <strong>Escape From Tarkov</strong> and <strong>Counter Strike</strong>. Sports I like to play include AFL and Basketball, and I also always love to catch up with mates and also go driving.</p>
