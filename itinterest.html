                <h1>What is your interest in I.T? When did your interest in I.T start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h1>
                <p>Ever since a child, I have been exposed to I.T. Spanning from the very first device, the <strong>Leapfrog</strong>, to the gaming computer I built to experiment with I.T more, this field has been very prominent in my life.</p>
                <p>My interest is the ability to discover and adapt to new technology in an ever-changing environment. I find that if I'm given a textbook and told to read and learn a new way of doing something, it is more time consuming than my ability to <em>grasp</em> a technological device and understand its workings within hours.</p>
                <p>This way of learning sparks my interest for I.T and I also get such profound excitement at learning about new devices and forefronts in this field. I am also heavily interested in <strong>exploitation</strong> of I.T devices and the way we can amend problems in them to create a more secure world, not only for ourselves, but for the greater world and protect <strong>major assets</strong> that contribute to humanity's success. To address if there was a particular event or person that sparked my interest... no not particularly. It was more the accumulation of years of exposure and streamlining myself down a <strong>technological pathway</strong> throughout school that sparks my interest every day. </p>
                <p>In terms of IT experience, I work currently at The Good Guys in the IT section which allows me to develop my knowledge of this field, as well as building my own computer and participating in software development classes in Year 12. I also developed a website for our local flying school and managed social media and customer relations. </p>

                    <h1>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
                    <p>There was a plethora of reasons why I chose to come to RMIT. Firstly, they attain one of the <strong>best rankings</strong> for computer science and information technology courses in Australia and provide industry-leading education that would enable me to understand and streamline into a pathway in this field upon graduation a lot easier.</p>
                    <p>Another reason is purely based on the <strong>location</strong> of the campus, since I live regional and have to catch public transportation into Melbourne every day, I wanted to minimize travel time and since RMIT attained an inner-city campus, allowed me to further strengthen my university choice. Also, I am highly interested in completing my <strong> master's degree in cybersecurity</strong> after I complete my bachelor's degree and RMIT offered this. </p>
                    <p>They also had a lot of options to specialize within your course and choose classes that you're interested in.</p>

                    <h1>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h1>
                    <p>I expect to learn a vast array of information and tools in relation to information technology ranging from <strong>basic-advanced coding</strong> through multiple languages such as <strong>python</strong> and <strong>html</strong>, <strong>web security</strong> and the handling of <strong>big data</strong>, the inner workings and query language of <strong>SQL</strong> and the way to develop a database and much more.</p>
                    <p>I would like to specialize in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> within this bachelor's degree down the track and what I would learn from this would include secure data handling techniques, threat mitigation, penetration testing and the use of <strong>software for security analysis</strong>. Apart from academics, I expect to learn also a lot about myself and <strong>those around me</strong>, their backgrounds, their history and all of us as a collective can develop and possibly become close friends moving into the future. </p>
